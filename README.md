# To-Do
A simple To-Do app in Node.js - WIP

It's a simple project to learn fundamentals of Restful APIs in Node.js.

Fundamentals included in this project:

- All CRUD Operations via HTTP Requests;
- Connection with MongoDB using Mongoose;
- Heroku Deployment;
- Security: Hashs, Encryption, JWTs, Data Access Control.

OBS: The Testarea folder has only files for messing around with some code and getting used to some syntaxes.
